## Books

### [Mindstorms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/703532.Mindstorms) by Seymour Papert / 1993

Computers have completely changed the way we teach children. We have Mindstorms to thank for that. In this book, pioneering computer scientist Seymour Papert uses the invention of LOGO, the first child-friendly programming language, to make the case for the value of teaching children with computers. Papert argues that children are more than capable of mastering computers, and that teaching computational processes like debugging in the classroom can change the way we learn everything else. He also shows that schools saturated with technology can actually improve socialization and interaction among students and between students and teachers.

Technology changes every day, but the basic ways that computers can help us learn remain. For thousands of teachers and parents who have sought creative ways to help children learn with computers, Mindstorms is their bible.


## Papers

### [Can Programming Be Liberated, Period?](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/papers/LiberatingProgramming.pdf) David Harel / 2008

the author describes his dream about freeing ourselves from the straightjackets of programming, making the process of getting computers to do what we want intuitive, natural, and also fun. He recommends harnessing the great power of computing and transforming a natural and almost playful means of programming so that it becomes fully operational and machine-doable.


### [Declarative Programming: The Light at the End of theTunnel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Lampson-Declarative-Programming-final.pdf) Butler Lampson / 2010

As I thought about it, though, I realized that I don‚Äôt really know what declarative programming is. In fact, it seems to be an umbrella term for ‚Äúthe kind ofprogramming we wish we had.‚Äù


### [Out of the tar pit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf) / 2006

Complexity is the single major difficulty in the successful develop-
ment of large-scale software systems. Following Brooks we distinguish
accidental from essential difficulty, but disagree with his premise that
most complexity remaining in contemporary systems is essential. We
identify common causes of complexity and discuss general approaches
which can be taken to eliminate them where they are accidental in
nature. To make things more concrete we then give an outline for
a potential complexity-minimizing approach based on functional pro-
gramming and Codd‚Äôs relational model of data.
